# The Scenario
Physical therapy is an important routine for recovering patients at hospitals. It is usually led in a 
group session where patients follow direct instructions on how to perform physical exercises to 
regain muscle strength following incidents such as stroke. In collaboration  with 
[Saint-Vincent Hospital](https://www.bruyere.org/en/s-saint-vincent-hospital), we built Kinect the Rhythm
to make rehabilitation therapy more enjoyable for the patients.
